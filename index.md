## Manipulating and analysing DNA sequences
* We will deal here mostly with sequences in fasta format

### Extracting sequences from multifasta files with [SeqTk](notes/tuto_seqtk.md)
* Typically
    * make a list of the sequence names, edit the list and extract the sequences from the edited list
    * extract specific portions of sequence using lists (bed files) or directly one single portion ta the command line

### Using [BLAST](notes/tuto_blast.md) with the command line.
### Multiple alignment with [MAFFT](notes/tuto_mafft.md)

## Exploring, editing and subsetting large files in linux
### navigating a file with [less](notes/Unix_Less_Commands.md)
### Editing: use nano in unix or editor such as vscode
* Windows and others cause compatibility problems. Is Notepad still useable?

### Selecting lines and columns and choosing field separators with [awk](notes/AWK.md)

### Notes on [BASH](notes/BASHnotes.md)
